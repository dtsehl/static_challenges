# Static Comp Challenges

I attempted the first challenge (challenge1.png) and timeboxed my work to two hours. I did not get very far and felt my time was better spent continuing down the intermission work for SQL/Rails.

Much of my time spent on this project was dedicated to looking up how CSS interacts with HTML and checking the output to make sure I was on the right path.

I also did not practice great version control as I did not realize at the time of doing the work that this would be submitted as a deliverable.
